**To run the programs simply type make and then run ./q1 or ./q2.**
./q1 needs a program to run, so simply type something like "./q1 vim" something like that.
It can take more than on command so you could even do something like "./q1 vim "hello.txt".

The program works as shown in Franklin's class. I'm really happy about this considering how badly
I messed up on Assignment 1. Not much to say, everything works as expected. The written answer for 
question 2 is in "question 2 report.md", not here.

HAPPY MARKING :)!
